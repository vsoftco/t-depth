Sorted parents by size:    [(0,1)]
Computing the children nodes...
	Computing children of parent hyper-node: 0 [size: 1]
		[*] Took: 6 ms; Average per parent node: 6 ms
Number of children nodes (USH size): 122
Now displaying the children nodes, unfiltered (SH): 
	(sde=3, delta_ham=-1, T_path=1) | count=12
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=1) | count=18
	(sde=2, delta_ham=-1, T_path=2) | count=12
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=2) | count=16
	(sde=4, delta_ham=1, T_path=2) | count=64
Children hyper-nodes before filtering (the P set): 1 2 
Children hyper-nodes after filtering (the P set): 1 2 
Minimal elements (filtered): 
	(sde=3, delta_ham=-1, T_path=1) | count=12
	(sde=2, delta_ham=-1, T_path=2) | count=12
Filtering the children nodes in all children hyper-nodes...
