n = 3
IN: sde = 2
IN: max T-depth target = 2

PARENT LEVEL i: 1
# of parent hyper-nodes: 1
Parent hyper-node (T-path): 0
	1 nodes (unitaries)
Computing the children nodes...
Sorted parents by size: [(0,1)]
	Computing children of parent hyper-node: 0 [size: 1]
Number of children nodes (USH size): 2282
Now displaying the children nodes, unfiltered (SH): 
	(sde=4, delta_ham=1, T_path=3) | count=72
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=3) | count=24
	(sde=5, delta_ham=1, T_path=3) | count=1256
	(sde=1, delta_ham=-1, T_path=1) | count=2
	(sde=2, delta_ham=0, T_path=2) | count=16
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=1) | count=124
	(sde=4, delta_ham=1, T_path=2) | count=776
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=2) | count=12
Children hyper-nodes before filtering (the P set): 3 1 2 
Children hyper-nodes after filtering (the P set): 3 1 2 
Minimal elements (filtered): 
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=3) | count=24
	(sde=1, delta_ham=-1, T_path=1) | count=2
	(sde=3, delta_ham=1, T_path=2) | count=12
Filtering the children nodes in all children hyper-nodes...
Number of children nodes after filtering (size of G): 38
------------------
OUT:
T-depth: 2
T-path: 2
We finished when sde == 1, C0 not available
Filtered G nodes per hyper-tree level: []
Max. num. nodes per hyper-tree level: 1
Avg. num. nodes: 1
Took: 4500 ms
