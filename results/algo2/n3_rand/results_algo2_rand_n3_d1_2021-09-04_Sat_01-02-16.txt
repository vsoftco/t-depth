Algorithm 2
n = 3
IN: sde = 1
IN: T-depth target = 1
------------------
PARENT LEVEL i: 1
# of parent hyper-nodes: 1
Parents (hyper-node,size): [(0,1)]
Sorted parents by size:    [(0,1)]
Computing the children nodes...
	Computing children of parent hyper-node: 0 [size: 1]
Found a node with sde == 0, exiting

OUT:
T-depth: 1
T-path: 1
C0 sde: 0
Is C0 identity: false
Filtered G nodes per hyper-tree level: []
Max. num. nodes per hyper-tree level: 1
Avg. num. nodes: 1
